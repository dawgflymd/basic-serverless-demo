### What is this?
This is a quick demo repo containing boilerplate code 
for use in GCP's Firebase and Twilio's Serverless environments.

### What do I do with it?
Probably nothing, unless I've asked you to review it.
If that's the case, then do the following:
1. Install NVM then install Node 18 & 20
2. Using NPM (or Yarn, Bun, etc.), install the package modules from package.json
3. If using Firebase, upload code to Functions; if using Twilio, upload to Twilio Serverless FNs & upload Firebase 
   Service Account as an asset file (PRIVATE!)
4. Test to your heart's content

Instructions are meant to be slightly vague so you learn the fundamentals of the javascript world.

Have fun!
